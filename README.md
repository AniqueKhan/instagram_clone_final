A website, built with Django for the backend and Bootstrap alongside custom CSS for the frontend, bears a striking resemblance to Instagram's web version, albeit with a subset of its features. It encompasses an authentication system facilitating login, logout, signup, and password modification. A feed reminiscent of Instagram presents content from followed users, with the ability to create posts supported by image or video uploads and tagging. Users can like and save posts, comment on them, and create carousels for multiple media. Profile pages allow following/unfollowing, showcasing own posts and saved content, and updating profile details. A search engine aids in discovering posts, tags, and users. An inbox permits messaging between users, with real-time chat updates. Notifications notify users of likes, comments, and follows, with an option to delete them. Additionally, a story feature akin to Instagram's allows creation and viewing of stories from followed users.
